## Built With

m3mento is built for MiniPay using Celo Composer and the following front-end frameworks and asset libraries:

- [Celo](https://celo.org/), by deploying on the Celo Alfajores Testnet and demoing our DApp with MiniPay's Site Tester.
- [Copperx](https://dashboard.copperx.dev/products?status=all), to simplify crypto payments and get multi-currency support.
- [Nouns](https://nouns.wtf), to leverage their community-loved, easily recognizeable assets and public support.
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
